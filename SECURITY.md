## 🔐 Scope

The following components are **in‑scope** for security reporting:

* `elasti-controller`
* `elasti-resolver`
* Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests distributed in the official repository
* All container images published under `ghcr.io/truefoundry/elasti*`

Out‑of‑scope issues include but are not limited to:

* Third‑party dependencies (report upstream instead)
* Vulnerabilities requiring root or cluster‑admin access
* Best‑practice hardening suggestions without a concrete security impact

## 📬 Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Email** a detailed report to our private list: **[security@truefoundry.com](mailto:security@truefoundry.com)**.
2. Include:

   * A descriptive title (e.g., *"Denial‑of‑Service via oversized HTTP header"*).
   * Affected versions and environment details.
   * Reproduction steps or proof‑of‑concept (PoC) code.
   * Expected vs. actual behavior.
   * Impact assessment (confidentiality, integrity, availability).
   * *Optional* patch or mitigation ideas.
3. *Do NOT* open a public GitHub issue for security problems.

## 🔄 Disclosure Policy

* We follow **coordinated disclosure**.
* We publish a GitHub Security Advisory and release notes once a patch is available.
* We credit reporters **unless anonymity is requested**.
* If a vulnerability is found to be already public, we will fast‑track patching and disclosure.

We currently do **not** offer a monetary bug bounty, but we are happy to provide **swag** and public recognition.
