# KubeElasti vs KEDA HTTP Add-on

This document provides a comprehensive technical comparison between KubeElasti and KEDA HTTP Add-on, specifically focusing on HTTP-based scaling scenarios with scale-to-zero capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

### KubeElasti Architecture

KubeElasti implements a dual-mode architecture with intelligent traffic management:

- **Controller/Operator**: Manages ElastiService CRDs and orchestrates scaling decisions based on configurable triggers
- **Resolver**: Acts as HTTP proxy/load balancer with dynamic routing capabilities  
- **Smart Mode Switching**: Automatically switches between modes based on replica count
- **Dual Mode Operation**:
      - **Proxy Mode (Replicas = 0):** Intercepts/queues and buffers traffic until pods are brought online.
      - **Serve Mode (Replicas > 0):** Bypasses proxy for direct routing, maximizing throughput and minimizing latency.
- **Prometheus Integration**: Built-in metrics collection and query-based scaling triggers

### KEDA HTTP Add-on Architecture

KEDA HTTP Add-on provides event-driven autoscaling through a proxy-based system:

- **KEDA Operator**: Manages ScaledObject CRDs and HPA integration
- **HTTP Add-on Operator**: Manages HTTPScaledObject CRDs and configures interceptors
- **HTTP Interceptor**: Always-on proxy that handles all HTTP traffic and maintains request queues
- **External Scaler**: Communicates queue metrics to KEDA using external-push scaler pattern
- **HPA Integration**: Leverages Kubernetes HPA for actual scaling operations

## Scaling Mechanisms

| Feature | KubeElasti | KEDA HTTP Add-on |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| **Scaling Trigger** | Prometheus queries with custom metrics | HTTP request queue depth (pending requests) |
| **Scale-to-Zero** | Native support with proxy mode activation | Supported via interceptor queue management |
| **Scale-from-Zero** | Automatic via resolver proxy with request queueing | Request queuing in always-on interceptor |
| **Scaling Algorithm** | Custom controller with configurable thresholds and cooldown periods | HPA-based with external-push metrics from interceptor |
| **Cold Start Handling** | Intelligent proxy buffering during scale-up | Request queuing with configurable pending request thresholds |
| **Scaling Speed** | Immediate (proxy mode) or Configurable polling intervals (default: 30s) | HPA-controlled (default: 15s) with scaledownPeriod configuration |

## Traffic Management Patterns

### KubeElasti Traffic Flow

```text
[In Proxy]
Client Request → Resolver → Target Service
↓
Prometheus Metrics → Controller → Scaling Decision → Mode Switch

[In Serve]
Client Request → Target Service
↓
Prometheus Metrics → Controller → Scaling Decision → Mode Switch
```

**Proxy Mode (Replicas = 0)**: Resolver acts as reverse proxy, queues requests during scaling
**Serve Mode (Replicas > 0)**: Direct routing to target service, resolver out of critical path

### KEDA HTTP Add-on Traffic Flow

```text
Client Request → HTTP Interceptor (Always-On) → Target Service
↓
Queue Metrics → External Scaler → KEDA Operator → HPA → Scaling Decision
```

**Always-On Proxy**: HTTP interceptor remains in request path regardless of scaling state
**Queue-Based Metrics**: Scaling decisions based on in-flight request count and pending queue depth

## Configuration Complexity

### KubeElasti Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: elasti.truefoundry.com/v1alpha1
kind: ElastiService
metadata:
  name: example-service
  namespace: default
spec:
  service: example-service
  minTargetReplicas: 1
  cooldownPeriod: 300
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: target-deployment
  triggers:
    - type: prometheus
      metadata:
        serverAddress: http://prometheus:9090
        query: 'sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) or vector(0)'
        threshold: '0.1'
```

### KEDA HTTP Add-on Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: http.keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: HTTPScaledObject
metadata:
  name: example-http-scaledobject
spec:
  hosts:
    - example.com
  scaleTargetRef:
    deployment: target-deployment
    service: target-service
    port: 8080
  replicas:
    min: 0
    max: 10
  scaledownPeriod: 300
  targetPendingRequests: 100
---
# Note: ScaledObject is automatically created by the HTTPScaledObject operator
# with external-push trigger configuration
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **KubeElasti**: Higher throughput in serve mode due to direct routing bypass
- **KEDA HTTP Add-on**: Consistent throughput with always-on proxy, but potential bottleneck under high load

## Operational Considerations

### KubeElasti

**Advantages**:
- Intelligent mode switching reduces proxy overhead during normal operations
- Built-in Prometheus integration with flexible query-based triggers
- Simpler architecture with fewer moving components
- Lower resource footprint when scaled up (serve mode)

**Limitations**:
- Requires Prometheus for advanced scaling capabilities
- Newer project with smaller ecosystem and community
- Limited scaler types compared to KEDA
- Less enterprise adoption

### KEDA HTTP Add-on

**Advantages**:
- Mature ecosystem with extensive scaler support (70+ built-in scalers)
- Standard HPA integration with Kubernetes-native patterns
- Multiple trigger types beyond HTTP (databases, queues, etc.)

**Limitations**:
- Always-on proxy overhead even when not scaling
- More complex multi-component architecture (operator + interceptor + scaler)
- Beta stage with potential production limitations
- Limited customization of scaling algorithms

## Technical Trade-offs Summary

| Consideration | KubeElasti | KEDA HTTP Add-on |
|---------------|------------|------------------|
| **Architectural Complexity** | Lower | Higher |
| **Performance (Scaled Up)** | Better (no proxy) | Good (always-on proxy) |
| **Performance (Scale-from-zero)** | Good (queued requests) | Good (queued requests) |  
| **Ecosystem Maturity** | Beta | Beta |
| **Operational Overhead** | Lower | Higher |
| **Flexibility** | High (custom triggers) | Very High (70+ scalers) |
| **Resource Efficiency** | Higher (proxy switching) | Lower (always-on proxy) |


## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose KubeElasti When

- **Performance optimization is critical** (serve mode benefits are significant)
- **Prometheus-centric monitoring stack** already in place
- **Simplified operational model preferred** with fewer components
- **Direct routing benefits** outweigh always-on proxy patterns
- **Resource efficiency** during scaled-up state is important

### Choose KEDA HTTP Add-on When

- **Multi-trigger scaling requirements** (HTTP + queue + database triggers)
- **Enterprise support and ecosystem maturity** needed
- **Existing KEDA infrastructure** already deployed
- **Beta limitations acceptable** for your use case
- **Consistent proxy behavior** preferred over mode switching


## Conclusion

Both KubeElasti and KEDA HTTP Add-on solve the scale-to-zero challenge for HTTP workloads but with fundamentally different architectural approaches. KubeElasti's dual-mode architecture offers performance benefits when scaled up. KEDA HTTP Add-on provides proven patterns with extensive ecosystem support but maintains always-on proxy overhead.

The choice between them should be based on your specific requirements for performance, operational complexity, ecosystem maturity, and long-term architectural goals.
