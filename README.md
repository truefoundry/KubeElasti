# Elasti

Elasti is a cloud-native tool to facilitate serverless capabilities within Kubernetes services. It intercepts and queues requests directed to a service that has been scaled down to zero instances, then scales the service up, and subsequently forwards the queued requests to the now active service.


>  The name Elasti comes from a superhero "Elasti-Girl" from DC Comics. Her supower is to expand or shrink her body at willâ€”from hundreds of feet tall to mere inches in height.

# Problem Statement
TBA

# Installation / Deployment on K8s

You can install the Elasti Tool by running the following command:
```bash
make deploy

or 

helm install elasti ./charts/elasti -n elasti
```

After this, you can start creating elastiService. You can find a sample at `demo-elastiService.yaml`.

## Uninstallation 

To uninstall Elasti, **you will need to remove all the CRDs first.** Then, simply delete the installation file. 
```bash
make undeploy

or 

helm uninstall elasti -n elasti
```

# Development

Here are the steps to deploy Elasti in your Kubernetes cluster. For now, we will need to deploy the Elasti-Operator and Elasti-Resolver separately.

### Setup Docker

This is required to publish our Docker images and pull them inside our manifest files. 

1. Login to the Docker Hub via CLI.
```bash
docker login -u ramantehlan
# When asked for password, paste below text.
dckr_pat_WgMJEsO0nMNp10Bf7rLQ_FcVzLU
``` 

> That's it, now you will be able to push changes to images. Since the images are public, pulling it doesn't require any changes.

### Build Resolver

We will build and publish our resolver changes.

1. Go into the resolver directory. 
2. Run the build and publish command.
```bash
make docker-buildx IMG=ramantehlan/elasti-resolver:v1alpha1
```

### Build Operator

We will build and publish our Operator changes.

1. Go into the operator directory.
2. Run the build and publish command.
```bash
make docker-buildx IMG=ramantehlan/elasti-operator:v1alpha1
```

> Once your changes are published, you can re-deploy them in your cluster.

# Configuration
TBA

# Playground 

```
make docker-build docker-publish IMG=localhost:5001/elasti-operator:v1alpha1
make docker-build docker-publish IMG=localhost:5001/elasti-resolver:v1alpha1
```
