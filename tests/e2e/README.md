# Elasti E2E Testing Framework

This directory contains an End-to-End (E2E) testing framework for the Elasti Kubernetes operator system using KUTTL (KUbernetes Test TooL). The framework provides a comprehensive way to validate Elasti's core functionality in a realistic Kubernetes environment.

## Requirements

### System Requirements

- Docker (for Kind)
- Go 1.20+
- Make

### Tools

- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) (Kubernetes in Docker) v0.17.0+
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) v1.25.0+
- [kuttl](https://kuttl.dev/) v0.15.0+

  ```bash
    # Using Krew (Kubernetes plugin manager)
    kubectl krew install kuttl

    # Or using Go
    go install github.com/kudobuilder/kuttl/cmd/kubectl-kuttl@latest
  ```

### Development Environment

- Linux, macOS, or WSL2 on Windows
- At least 4GB of free memory for the Kind cluster
- At least 10GB of free disk space

## Directory Structure

The E2E testing framework is organized into the following directories:

```bash
elasti/tests/e2e/
├── tests/                     # KUTTL test definitions
│   └── 00-elasti-setup/      # Individual test case
│       └── 00-assert.yaml    # Test step (assertion)
├── temp/                      # Work-in-progress tests
├── manifest/                  # Kubernetes manifests and values files
│   ├── elasti-chart-values.yaml  # Elasti helm chart values
│   ├── target-deployment.yaml    # Test deployment manifest
│   ├── target-elastiservice.yaml # ElastiService CR manifest
│   ├── istio-gateway.yaml        # Istio gateway configuration
│   ├── target-virtualService.yaml # Istio virtual service
│   └── traffic-job.yaml          # Traffic generator job
├── kind-config.yaml           # Kind cluster configuration
├── Makefile                   # Test automation commands
├── kuttl-test.yaml            # KUTTL test suite configuration
└── README.md                  # This file
```

- **`manifest/`**: Contains Kubernetes manifest files and Helm values files
- **`tests/`**: Contains the actual KUTTL tests
  - Each directory represents an individual test.
  - Each file within a test directory represents a step in that test.
  - Each step follows the naming convention with prefix 00-, 01-, etc. for execution ordering.
- **`temp/`**: Contains work-in-progress tests and experimental scenarios
- **`kind-config.yaml`**: Configuration for the Kind cluster used in testing
- **`kuttl-test.yaml`**: Configuration file for KUTTL tests
  - Contains commands that run before test execution

## Test Scenarios

The framework includes the following test scenarios:

1. **Setup Check**: Test if setup is in desired state.
2. **Enable Proxy Mode**: Tests Elasti's ability to switch to proxy mode when scaling a deployment to zero.
3. **Enable Serve Mode**: Tests Elasti's ability to switch back to serve mode after receiving traffic.

## Running Tests

### Quick Start

> Note: Docker daemon should be running for the tests to work.

To run the complete test suite:

```bash
// Setup the environment
// Run this only first time
make setup

// Run all tests
make test

or

// Run specific test
make test T=00-elasti-setup
```

### Individual Commands

You can also run specific parts of the testing process:

| Command                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

```

The E2E testing pipeline follows these detailed steps:

1. **Registry Setup**

   - A Docker registry is started on port 5002
   - This registry will store the locally built operator and resolver images

2. **Kind Cluster Creation**

   - A Kind cluster is created using the configuration in `kind-config.yaml`
   - The registry is connected to the Kind network to allow image pulling

3. **Image Building and Publishing**

   - Elasti operator and resolver images are built from source
   - Images are tagged and pushed to the local registry

4. **Dependency Installation**

   - **Istio Ingress**: Sets up the ingress gateway for routing external traffic
   - **Prometheus**: Installed for metrics collection (without Grafana to reduce overhead)
   - **KEDA**: Installed for event-driven autoscaling capabilities
   - **Elasti**: The operator and CRDs are installed using Helm

5. **Test Initialization**

   - Persistent, lightweight resources are applied via the `kuttl-test.yaml` config
   - These resources are shared across all test cases

6. **Test Execution**

   - Tests are executed in order based on their numerical prefix
   - Each folder in the `tests/` directory represents an independent test
   - Each file within a test folder represents steps of that test
   - Tests can run in parallel if enabled, with no cross-dependencies between test folders

7. **Test Cleanup**
   - Resources are cleaned up after each test completes

## Test configuration

The test configuration is defined in the `kuttl-test.yaml` file.
There is a `timeout` field in the `kuttl-test.yaml` file, which is set to 30s by default. This is the timeout for each test step.

## Testing Environment

The testing environment consists of:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Kind Cluster"
        subgraph "elasti namespace"
            OP[Elasti Operator]
            CRD[Elasti CRDs]
        end

        subgraph "monitoring namespace"
            PROM[Prometheus Server]
        end

        subgraph "default namespace"
            D[Test Deployment]
            ES[ElastiService CR]
            TF[Traffic Generator]
        end

        PROM -- metrics --> OP
        OP -- monitors --> ES
        ES -- controls --> D
        TF -- generates traffic --> D
    end
```

## Adding New Tests

To add a new test scenario:

1. Create a new directory in the `tests/e2e/tests/` directory following the KUTTL format, `<number>-<test-name>`.
2. Define test steps with commands and assertions, in the directory using `<number>-<step-name>.yaml` format.
3. Add any supporting files or manifests needed
4. To run the test individually, use:
   ```bash
   make test T=<number>-<test-name>
   ```
  
### Example:

```bash
make test T=00-elasti-setup
```

## KUTTL Test Files Structure

KUTTL tests follow a specific structure:

```bash
tests/
└── 00-elasti-setup/            # Test case (folder named with numbered prefix)
    ├── 00-apply.yaml           # First step - apply resources, created the required scenario.
    ├── 01-wait.yaml            # Second step - wait for resources to be ready.
    └── 02-assert.yaml          # Third step - assertion
```

- **Each directory represents an individual test** (This number doesn't determine order, that works only for steps inside the directory)
- Each file within a test directory **represents a step in that test**
- Steps follow naming convention with prefix 00-, 01-, etc. for execution ordering
  - For example, `00-assert.yaml` is the first step in the test, `01-apply.yaml` is the second step, and so on.
  - Same doesn't apply for folders in `tests/e2e/tests/` directory. We still follow the same naming for them just to keep it consistent.

### Run Single Test

```bash
make test T=00-elasti-setup
```

### Example Test Structure

```yaml
# Test step to assert elasti operator, resolver and target deployment are running, and if elasti service is in serve mode.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: elasti-operator-controller-manager
  namespace: elasti

```

## Tips for Writing KUTTL Tests

1. **Naming Convention**: Use numerical prefixes within test folders to know the sequence of test cases and files to control execution of the steps.
2. **Avoid Cross-Dependencies**: Each test folder should be independent of others.
3. **Reset after each test**: Each test should reset the environment in the last step to the default state, which is same as `kuttl-test.yaml`. **This is important, so that no test affects the next test**. All tests start in the default state, and then the state is modified to test the specific scenario and reset in the end.
4. **Use Timeouts Wisely**: Set appropriate timeouts for operations that may take time
5. **Resource Sharing**: Put shared resources in `kuttl-test.yaml` commands section
6. **Debugging**: Use `kubectl kuttl test --debug` for verbose output during test development
